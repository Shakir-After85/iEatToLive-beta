        You got this! I know how hard it may sometimes feel to stay on track,
        epecially when life happens. However, every time you do happen to feel
        that way, every time its starting to feel as if its getting to be too
        hard, as if you can no longer manage it on top of everything else you
        have to manage, take a moment and read me. Read me however many times
        you need to in order to get back to it! Remember why your doing this!
        Remember, its ok to make mistakes. Remember to be patient. Remember your
        health is everything. Health is wealth afterall. I know you want to be
        there for your kids or future kids and even grand kids. I know you want
        to be free from every and any ailment, so you can live your life to the
        fullest. I know you either have dear friends or family that depend on
        you, and if anything were to ever happened to you, it would destroy
        them. I know, however small it may be, you want to make a difference.
        Whether it maybe be in your life, his, hers, theirs, or even the world.
        Always remember that you can and every day that you are committing to
        this, you are!
